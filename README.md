# Odin Recipe Project
In this Odin Recipe Project, the project entailed working on putting all HTML knowledge. Learned from previous lessons and sections in the HTML portion of Odin Foundation. This project, challenged me to put together a recipe website. Using different 
HTML tags, elements and links. Such as setting up the HTML boilerplate for the index of the recipe website. To getting the file structure right for navigation the recipe website with different links from absolute and relative links depending on
where a certain webpage was located. 

I also leanred to implement images within our recipe webpage and adding different list for the ingredient and steps to make a certain dish. One being a unordered list for ingredients and ordered list for steps. Overall it was a pleasent experience building this simple project in HTML and my first project building a basic recipe website on "The Odin Project".
