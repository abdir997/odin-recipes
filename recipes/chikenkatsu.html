        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Katsu is a classic Japanese home-cooked meal served with tonkatsu sauce and a side of shredded cabbage salad. These tender and crispy panko-breaded cutlets are surprisingly easy to make, even on a busy weeknight! They also freeze well and make for a delicious meal prep menu.</p>
        <p>Chicken katsu (チキンカツ) is made of chicken breast fillet breaded with flour, egg, and Japanese panko breadcrumbs, then deep-fried until golden brown. It's the chicken counterpart of Tonkatsu or pork cutlet.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> 4 whole Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Water</li>
                <li>3 whole Eggs, whisked</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
                <li>3 cups Panko</li>
                <li>Canola Oil, for frying</li>
                <li>Steamed White Rice, to serve</li>
                <li>Toasted Sesame Seeds, for garnish</li>
                <li>Green Onion, chopped for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the chicken katsu, on a meat safe cutting board cover chicken thighs with plastic wrap, flatten using a meat mallet or heavy bottom pan, about 1/2 inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap and season with kosher salt.</li>
                <li>In a shallow dish whisk together water, eggs, cornstarch and kosher salt. Place panko in a separate shallow dish.</li>
                <li>In a large cast iron skillet or heavy bottomed pot fill with canola oil to {about 2 cups} and heat to 350 degrees F {always use a oil/candy thermometer to monitor temp}. Have a separate sheet pan lined with a rack handy for the chicken after frying.</li>
                <li>Dip the chicken thighs into egg mixture until coated. Dip into the panko and coat both sides. Fry in oil about 6 minutes per side until golden brown. Transfer to the pan lined with a rack to drain.</li>
                <li>Slice chicken and serve immediately with mac salad, tonkatsu sauce and steamed white rice, garnish with toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onion. Enjoy!</li>
